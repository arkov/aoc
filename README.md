- First time I tried [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in order to play some more with Python. Had to unfortunately stop midway ☹️
- surely not optimal
- code might smell more like C than Python - I'm thankful for feedback!
- if you dont like the formating (not a fan as well tbh) it's the black formater I started to use. surely it's not my fault 😋
