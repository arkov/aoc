# My AoC solutions
AoC (or [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023)) is a yearly event of daily programming challenges starting on Dec 1 and leading up to Christmas.
Right now **(2023)** I am using it to try out Rust for my first time, as I have never touched it before. Should you have any suggestions, please PR or send me a message. 
I'm as of now unsure how much time I can contribute to the language and challenges right now, so I might skip intervals of days.
But even current year's Rust code is better than my last year's Python rendition I fear, so that's that.

- First time I tried [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in order to play some more with Python. Had to unfortunately stop midway ‚òπÔ∏è
- surely not optimal
- code might smell more like C than Python - I'm thankful for feedback!
- if you dont like the formating (not a fan as well tbh) it's the black formater I started to use. surely it's not my fault üòã
